### Explainable AI Model For Lung Disease Classification

<p> In this project, I developed a framework for lung disease identification. To combat the black-box nature of the complex classification model and increase the transparency, explained the prediction of model output by different methods, i.e. Layerwise relevance propagation(LRP), Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation(LIME), Guided back-propagation (GB) and Deep Taylor decomposition (DTD). Further evaluated these explanations generated by using image entropy and evaluate heat maps generated by LRP, Guided backpropagation and Deep taylor decomposition using the pixel flipping algorithm.</p>
